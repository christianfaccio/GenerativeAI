# GenerativeAI
Generative AI and NLP resources, including tutorials on PyTorch and theory on NN


# Training Resources

The following are the resources I have identified for the first weeks of training, focusing mainly on PyTorch and Git:

## Git
- [GitHub Docs - Using Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git)
- [Microsoft Learn - GitHub Foundations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/github-foundations/) *(not compulsory but interesting)*

## Deep Learning 
- [Deep Learning](https://atcold.github.io/NYU-DLSP21/)

## PyTorch
- [How to Read PyTorch Code (Basic)](https://github.com/davidbau/how-to-read-pytorch)
- [DSSC Deep Learning Labs (Basic)](https://github.com/marcozullich/DSSC_DL_2021/tree/main/labs)
- [Deep Learning Units Labs (Basic: 01 + 02 + 03)](https://github.com/emaballarin/deeplearning-units/tree/main/labs)
- [PyTorch Tutorials (Introduction to PyTorch, Learning PyTorch, and Advanced Parallel & Distributed Training)](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)

## NLP
- [NLP with Deep Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
- [HF - entry level](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1)
- [HF - RAG and SQL](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/index)

## LLM Practicaal Intro
